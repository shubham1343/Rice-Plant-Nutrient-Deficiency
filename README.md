# Rice-Plant-Nutrient-Deficiency
This project is made by using Machine Learning concepts using Python. The main purpose of this project is to make a "Machine Learning Model" that will find the nutrient deficiency present in the given leaf image. Machine Learning algorithms are trained to classify rice plant images into different categories based on nutrient deficiency.
